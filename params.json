  "body": "# Hello, UH Manoa!\r\n<img class=\"ui huge image\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clubconnector/clubconnector.github.io/master/doc/club.jpg\">\r\n\r\nHi, and welcome to Club Connector. With over 200 clubs at UH Manoa, finding the right one for you can be challenging. The goal of this app is to make it easy for UH Manoa students to connect with clubs that they are interested in, so that they can have a richer and more fulfilling college experience.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://clubconnector.meteorapp.com/\">Click here to try our app!</a>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Guided Tour\r\n\r\n### User Pages\r\n\r\n#### Home/Landing Page(Before Login)\r\nWhen you first arrive at our website, you'll find two options:\r\n\r\n1. Browse through UH's 200+ clubs using our simple filters to find the perfect one for you.\r\n2. Log in with your UH username and password which lets you save a list of your favorite clubs and search filters, or manage your club page if you are a registered club admin.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"ui huge image\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clubconnector/clubconnector.github.io/master/doc/home-landing-M3.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Browse Club Page\r\nNow you will be able to begin your search for the perfect club! Here on the Browse page, you can select filters from the dropdown menu to find certain types of clubs, or just type something in the searchbox and our app will instantly show you any clubs with those words in their names.\r\n\r\nIf you're logged in you can click the star in the bottom right of a club's box to add that club as a favorite. You can click on the view button to go to that club's page to see more info.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"ui huge image\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clubconnector/clubconnector.github.io/master/doc/Browse_Clubs_M3.JPG\"> \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Club Page\r\nHere on the club page you will find more detailed information about the club.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"ui huge image\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clubconnector/clubconnector.github.io/master/doc/club-profile-M3.png\">\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Admin Pages\r\n\r\n#### Edit Club Page\r\nUsers who have registered as club administrators with our service can edit the information associated with their club on the Edit page. Contact the developers to inquire about receiving club administrator status.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"ui huge image\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clubconnector/clubconnector.github.io/master/doc/Edit_Club_M3.jpg\">\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Add Club Page\r\nUsers who are site admins also have the ability to add new clubs to the app.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"ui huge image\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clubconnector/clubconnector.github.io/master/doc/Add_Club_M3.jpg\">\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Initial User Study\r\nWe asked 5 current University of Hawaii students to review our website. They were given little information about the site other than that it was for finding clubs at UH. We then asked them to fill out a survey, and had a conversation about what they thought about the website.\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\n### Positive Feedback\r\n+ Clean, simple layout\r\n+ Nice, simple search features\r\n+ Results pop up as soon as I start typing\r\n+ I like the overall theme. It matched with UHM.\r\n\r\n### Constructive Criticism \r\n+ Less white! More color!\r\n+ The ability to see upcoming events for clubs was requested\r\n+ Navigation back to the front page was requested\r\n+ More info for clubs was also requested, including general descriptions, membership fees or requirements, and officer/member-wanted postings\r\n+ We were also asked to add mooaaar clubs\r\n\r\n## Response\r\n\r\n### Implemented Changes\r\n\r\nIn response to our initial user study we:\r\n\r\n1. Made the title link back to the landing page\r\n2. Changed the aesthetic design of the site, including adding more color\r\n3. Added a few moar clubs\r\n\r\n### Future Changes\r\n\r\nIn the future we would like to focus on helping clubs display a profile that they are proud of. Right now the add and edit club pages are a bit confusing. We would like to make it easier for them to keep their profiles up to date. We also want to add more information about the clubs, like member fees, and requirements.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Developer Guide\r\nDo you want to help us make Club Connector better?
