# Guided Tour

### User Pages

#### Home/Landing Page(Before Login)
When you first arrive at our website, you'll find two options:

1. Browse through UH's 200+ clubs using our simple filters to find the perfect one for you.
2. Log in with your UH username and password which lets you save a list of your favorite clubs and search filters, or manage your club page if you are a registered club admin.

#### Browse Club Page
Now you will be able to begin your search for the perfect club! Here on the Browse page, you can select filters from the dropdown menu to find certain types of clubs, or just type something in the searchbox and our app will instantly show you any clubs with those words in their names.

If you're logged in you can click the star in the bottom right of a club's box to add that club as a favorite. You can click on the view button to go to that club's page to see more info.

# Initial User Study
We asked 5 current University of Hawaii students to review our website. They were given little information about the site other than that it was for finding clubs at UH. We then asked them to fill out a survey, and had a conversation about what they thought about the website.

## Feedback

### Positive Feedback
+ Clean, simple layout
+ Nice, simple search features
+ Results pop up as soon as I start typing
+ I like the overall theme. It matched with UHM.

### Constructive Criticism 
+ Less white! More color!
+ The ability to see upcoming events for clubs was requested
+ Navigation back to the front page was requested
+ More info for clubs was also requested, including general descriptions, membership fees or requirements, and officer/member-wanted postings
+ We were also asked to add mooaaar clubs

## Response

### Implemented Changes

In response to our initial user study we:

1. Made the title link back to the landing page
2. Changed the aesthetic design of the site, including adding more color
3. Added a few moar clubs

### Future Changes

In the future we would like to focus on helping clubs display a profile that they are proud of. Right now the add and edit club pages are a bit confusing. We would like to make it easier for them to keep their profiles up to date. We also want to add more information about the clubs, like member fees, and requirements.
